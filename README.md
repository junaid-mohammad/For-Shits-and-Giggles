This repository contains the source code for **For Sh!ts and Giggles**, a dark-humored web app that fetches jokes using the **[JokeAPI](https://v2.jokeapi.dev/)**. Users can get random jokes or customize their search using categories, blacklist flags, type, and keywords in either English or French. The project focuses on building **RESTful API integrations**, handling **dynamic query parameters**, and creating a modern, responsive UI with a dark aesthetic.

## üéØ Purpose

**For Sh!ts and Giggles** was created to deepen my understanding of:

- Building full-stack web apps with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **EJS**.
- Making **RESTful API requests** from a server-side app.
- Structuring API **endpoints**, **path parameters**, and **dynamic query parameters**.
- Using **Axios** for promise-based HTTP requests.
- Applying **asynchronous programming** concepts like `async/await` and handling **promises**.
- Dynamically rendering content using **EJS** templating.
- Designing for **responsive dark mode UIs** using **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**.
- Deploying apps using **Azure App Service** and **Azure DevOps** CI/CD pipelines.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Random Joke Fetching**: Generates a joke as per the user's selected filters.
- **Custom Filtering**: Users can filter by categories, blacklist certain flags, select joke type, and even add keyword search.
- **Dynamic Server-Side Requests**: Utilizes **Axios** to fetch jokes from [JokeAPI](https://v2.jokeapi.dev/).
- **Persistent Form Values**: User selections remain after submission to streamline multiple requests.
- **Responsive Dark-Themed UI**: Modern and mobile-friendly design that matches the humor tone.
- **Error Handling**: Displays user-friendly error messages when no joke is found.
- **Dynamic Footer**: Includes real-time year and social/contact links.

## üöÄ Deployment & Workflow

The app is deployed to **Microsoft Azure App Service** and integrated with **Azure DevOps** for continuous deployment.

### üõ† Deployment Setup (Steps I Took)

1. **Created Azure App Service**

   - Set up a new App Service instance.

2. **Created GitHub Repo**

   - Initialized a new GitHub repository (`For-Shits-and-Giggles`) and pushed all project files.

3. **Created Azure DevOps Project**

   - Created a new project in Azure DevOps named _For Sh!ts and Giggles_.

4. **Added Azure DevOps as Git Remote**

   ```bash
   git remote add azure https://Junaid-Arif@dev.azure.com/Junaid-Arif/For%20Shits%20and%20Giggles/_git/For%20Shits%20and%20Giggles
   git push azure main
   ```

5. **Push to Both Remotes**

   ```bash
   git push origin main   # GitHub
   git push azure main    # Azure DevOps triggers deployment
   ```

6. **Linked Azure DevOps to App Service**

   - Configured Deployment Center in Azure App Service to pull from Azure DevOps.

7. **Tested CI/CD**

   - Confirmed that commits to Azure DevOps trigger automatic deployments.

8. **Port Configuration**

   ```javascript
   const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
   ```

### üî• Deployment Workflow (Current)

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main   # Updates GitHub
git push azure main    # Updates Azure DevOps & deploys automatically
```
